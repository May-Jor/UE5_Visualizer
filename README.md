# UE5_Visualizer
Made an interactive scene in UE5 that reacts to audio from the pc and can be controlled with a mobile device

Couldn't get the project to package, so I just decided to upload the whole thing so someone can use this as a reference.

Some photos of the scene

Here's what the controller looks like, can be used on a mobile device. TouchOSC was used to create and launch the controller, I've included the controller in this repo.
